# react-tetris

This is a version of Tetris built using React. It is a simple implementation of the game, with the ability to move and rotate the pieces, and to clear lines. The game is over when the pieces reach the top of the board.

The game can be played with keyboard arrow keys. The controls are as follows:

- Left arrow: move the piece to the left
- Right arrow: move the piece to the right
- Down arrow: move the piece down one row
- Up arrow: immediately drop the piece to the bottom of the board
- r: rotate the piece
- s: store the piece for later use, or swap the stored piece with the current piece
